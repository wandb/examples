The bottom purple bar represents model \"CNN-2, 5 epochs\" (id 1), which trained for 5 epochs. The images are filtered to cases where the models disagree. For example, in the first row, the \"4\" gets high scores across all the possible digits after 1 epoch, but after 5 epochs it scores highest on the correct label and very low on the rest.\n",
