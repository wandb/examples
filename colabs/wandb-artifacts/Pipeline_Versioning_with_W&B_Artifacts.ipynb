    "An \"artifact\", like a Greek [amphora üè∫](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphora),\n",
    "is a produced object -- the output of a process.\n",
    "In ML, the most important artifacts are _datasets_ and _models_.\n",
    "\n",
    "And, like the [Cross of Coronado](https://indianajones.fandom.com/wiki/Cross_of_Coronado), these important artifacts belong in a museum!\n",
    "That is, they should be cataloged and organized\n",
    "so that you, your team, and the ML community at large can learn from them.\n",
    "After all, those who don't track training are doomed to repeat it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using our Artifacts API, you can log `Artifact`s as outputs of W&B `Run`s or use `Artifact`s as input to `Run`s, as in this diagram,\n",
    "where a training run takes in a dataset and produces a model.\n",
    " \n",

    "\n",
    "Since one run can use another's output as an input, Artifacts and Runs together form a directed graph -- actually, a bipartite [DAG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph)! -- with nodes for `Artifact`s and `Run`s\n",
