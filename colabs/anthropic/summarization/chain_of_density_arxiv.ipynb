        "    summary=\"Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has recently emerged as a promising solution to alleviate Large Language Model (LLM)'s deficiency in lack of knowledge. Existing RAG datasets, however, do not adequately represent the diverse and dynamic nature of real-world Question Answering (QA) tasks. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Comprehensive RAG Benchmark (CRAG), a factual question answering benchmark of 4,409 question-answer pairs and mock APIs to simulate web and Knowledge Graph (KG) search. CRAG is designed to encapsulate a diverse array of questions across five domains and eight question categories, reflecting varied entity popularity from popular to long-tail, and temporal dynamisms ranging from years to seconds. Our evaluation on this benchmark highlights the gap to fully trustworthy QA. Whereas most advanced LLMs achieve <=34% accuracy on CRAG, adding RAG in a straightforward manner improves the accuracy only to 44%. State-of-the-art industry RAG solutions only answer 63% questions without any hallucination. CRAG also reveals much lower accuracy in answering questions regarding facts with higher dynamism, lower popularity, or higher complexity, suggesting future research directions. The CRAG benchmark laid the groundwork for a KDD Cup 2024 challenge, attracting thousands of participants and submissions within the first 50 days of the competition. We commit to maintaining CRAG to serve research communities in advancing RAG solutions and general QA solutions.\",\n",

The paper includes extensive empirical evaluation and discusses experiments integrating image, video, and speech capabilities via a compositional approach. The authors publicly release Llama 3, including pre-trained and post-trained versions of the 405B parameter language model and the Llama Guard 3 model for input and output safety.\",\n",

        "\n",
        "In this section, we leverage Claude 3 Sonnet's advanced vision capabilities to convert images from ArXiv PDFs into detailed textual descriptions. This process is crucial for creating a comprehensive text-based representation of the entire paper, including figures and diagrams.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Components:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Vector Graphic Conversion**:\n",
        "   - The `convert_vector_graphic_page_to_image` function handles vector graphics in PDFs, converting them to PNG images for further processing.\n",
        "   - This step is essential for capturing complex diagrams and charts that are often present in scientific papers.\n",
        "   - If direct image extraction is not possible (e.g., for SVGs or other vector graphics), the function converts the entire page to an image.\n",
        "   - In such cases, the LLM is instructed to focus solely on describing the images on the page, ignoring any text content.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Image Processing**:\n",
        "   - Two main functions, `process_figure_image` and `process_vector_image_pdf`, utilize Claude 3 Sonnet to analyze and describe images.\n",
        "   - `process_figure_image` focuses on individual figures, providing detailed technical descriptions.\n",
        "   - `process_vector_image_pdf` handles full PDF pages that may contain multiple vector graphics.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Image Extraction and Description**:\n",
        "   - The `extract_images` function iterates through PDF pages, extracting both raster images and vector graphics.\n",
        "   - It calls the appropriate processing function for each image type, generating textual descriptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Text Integration**:\n",
        "   - `replace_images_with_descriptions` combines the extracted text from the PDF with the generated image descriptions.\n",
        "   - This creates a unified text document that includes both the original text and detailed descriptions of all visual elements.\n",
        "\n",
        "By converting images to text, we ensure that the chain of density summarization process can incorporate information from all aspects of the paper, including visual data. This comprehensive approach allows for more accurate and informative summaries, especially for papers with significant visual content."

In this section, we'll explore how to implement CoD for ArXiv PDF summarization, including specific preprocessing and postprocessing steps to evaluate the model's performance.\n",

        "Chain of Density is an iterative approach to summarization that progressively refines and condenses information. The process involves several key steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Initial Summarization**: Starting with the full document, the `summarize_current_summary` function creates an initial summary focused on a specific instruction.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Iterative Refinement**: The `iterative_density_summarization` function repeatedly calls `summarize_current_summary`, each time taking the previous summary as input. This process:\n",
        "   - Identifies new, important technical entities or ideas from the original text\n",
        "   - Incorporates these new elements into the summary\n",
        "   - Increases overall information density while maintaining focus on the instruction\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Final Condensation**: After multiple iterations, the `final_summary` function creates an extremely dense summary, aiming to reduce length by 30-40% while retaining all critical technical content.\n",

        "This section introduces an advanced technique to enhance the Chain of Density (CoD) summarization process for ArXiv PDFs. By incorporating a chunking mechanism, we can handle longer documents more effectively and potentially improve the quality of our summaries. Here's an overview of the augmented CoD summarization process:\n",
        "\n",
        "### Augmented Chain of Density Summarization\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Chunk the Text**: We split the input text into manageable chunks using the `chunk_text` function. This function intelligently handles document structure, including image descriptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Iterative Chunk Summarization**: For each chunk, we apply the CoD process using `summarize_chunk`. This creates summaries for individual sections of the document.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Combine Chunk Summaries**: We use `summarize_chunk_summaries` to integrate information from all chunk summaries into a cohesive whole.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Iterative Refinement**: We repeat steps 2-3 for a specified number of iterations (`chunk_iterations`) to progressively refine the summary.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Final Density Pass**: After chunk-based summarization, we apply the standard CoD process to further refine and densify the final summary.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key components of this process include:\n",
        "\n",
        "- `chunk_text`: Splits the document into manageable pieces.\n",
        "- `summarize_chunk`: Applies CoD to individual chunks.\n",
        "- `summarize_chunk_summaries`: Combines chunk summaries.\n",
        "- `summarize_chunk_iteration`: Manages the iteration process for chunk summarization.\n",
        "- `iterative_chunk_summarization`: Orchestrates the entire chunk-based summarization process.\n",
        "- `chain_of_density_summarization`: Integrates chunking with the final CoD refinement.\n",
        "\n",
        "This augmented approach allows us to:\n",
        "1. Handle longer documents more effectively.\n",
        "2. Potentially capture more nuanced information from different parts of the paper.\n",
        "3. Provide a more comprehensive summary that considers the entire document structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "The `ArxivChainOfDensityPipeline` class has been updated to incorporate these new features, allowing for easy experimentation with different chunk sizes and iteration counts.\n",
        "\n",
        "To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, we've also extended our `quality_scorer` function to analyze the chunk-based summaries separately. This gives us insights into how the chunking process affects summary quality at different stages of the pipeline.\n",
        "\n",
