    "First things first; Transfer learning(TL) is not a machine learning model or technique; it is rather a \"**design methodology**\" within machine learning. The general idea of transfer learning is to use knowledge learned from tasks for which a lot of labelled data is available in settings where only little labelled data is available. Creating labelled data is expensive, so optimally leveraging existing datasets is key.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a traditional machine learning model, the primary goal is to generalise to unseen data based on patterns learned from the training data. With transfer learning, you attempt to kickstart this generalisation process by starting from patterns that have been learned for a different task. Essentially, instead of starting the learning process from a (often randomly initialised) blank sheet, you start from patterns that have been learned to solve a different task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolutional Neural Networks' features are more generic in early layers and more original-dataset-specific in later layers. Thus, we often use these as a backbone / starting point while creating new models. A common practice is to make these base models non-trainable and just learn the later layers. You might think that this will decrease the performance, but as we'll see from training. Transfer Learning is still a viable option."

    "**Dense Convolutional Network (DenseNet)**, connects each layer to every other layer in a feed-forward fashion. Whereas traditional convolutional networks with $L$ layers have $L$ connections - one between each layer and its subsequent layer - our network has $L(L+1)/2$ direct connections. For each layer, the feature-maps of all preceding layers are used as inputs, and its own feature-maps are used as inputs into all subsequent layers. DenseNets have several compelling advantages: they alleviate the vanishing-gradient problem, strengthen feature propagation, encourage feature reuse, and substantially reduce the number of parameters.\n",
