    "The manual logging methods (`WeaveTracer` and `weave_tracing_enabled`) are similar to using request callbacks in individual parts of a LangChain application. These methods provide finer control over which parts of your application are traced:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Constructor Callbacks:** Applied to the entire chain or component, logging all interactions consistently.\n",
    "- **Request Callbacks:** Applied to specific requests, allowing detailed tracing of particular invocations.\n",

    "By integrating Weave with LangChain, you can ensure comprehensive logging and monitoring of your LLM applications, facilitating easier debugging and performance optimization.\n",

    "Organizing and evaluating LLMs in applications for various use cases is challenging with multiple components, such as prompts, model configurations, and inference parameters.
