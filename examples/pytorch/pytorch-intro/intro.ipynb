    "1. Storing hyperparameters and metadata in a `config`.\n",
    "2. Tracking your model with `wandb.watch` to automatically log your model gradients and parameters. We'll also grab bunch of system metrics, like GPU and CPU utilization.\n",

    "1. **Define the sweep:** We do this by creating a dictionary or a [YAML file](https://docs.wandb.com/library/sweeps/configuration) that specifies the parameters to search through, the search strategy, the optimization metric et all.\n",

    "2. **Initialize the sweep:** \n",
